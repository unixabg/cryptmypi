#########################################################
Cryptmypi stage-2 requires a stage-1 prepared Kali Linux
root folder!

Cryptmypi stage-2 will attempt to perform the following
operations on the sdcard:
     1. Partition and format the sdcard.
     2. Create bootable sdcard with LUKS encrypted root
        partition.

The following screen will display a sanity check to
verify we are working with the correct block device.

##################### W A R N I N G #####################
This process can damage your local install if the script
has the wrong block device for your system.

******************** P l e a s e ************************
Double check and know you have the correct block device
that matches your sdcard.

##################### W A R N I N G #####################
  ** ** ** There is no undoing these actions! ** ** **
  ** ** **  If you are unsure DO NOT proceed. ** ** **

-------------------Sanity Check Prompt ------------------
This is a listing of your system block devices:

$(lsblk)

And below is the block device to be used with the script:

block device:  ${_BLKDEV}

If the block device is wrong DO NOT continue. Adjust the
block device in the cryptmypi.conf file located in they
config directory. After adjusting the block device run
the stage-2.sh script again.

To continue type in the phrase 'Yes, do as I say!'
